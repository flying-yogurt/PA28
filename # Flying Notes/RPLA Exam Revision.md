### Performance

- Pressure Altitude
  - Pressure altitude is a the equivalent altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere.
  - Only if the datum (QNH) is 1013.2 hPa, the altimeter indicates pressure altitude.
  - `PA = Elevation - 30 * (QNH - 1013)`
  - **Eg. Cooma Aerodrome**
    - `Elevation: 3106 ft & QNH 1000 hPa`
    - `PA = 3106 - 30 * (1000 - 1013)`
    - `PA = 3106 + 390 = 3496 ft`
- Density Altitude
  - The density altitude is the altitude relative to standard atmospheric conditions at which the air density would be equal to the indicated air density at the place of observation.
  - Density Altitude is corresponding to the density in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).
  - DA is PA corrected for the temperature
  - `ISA Temperature = 15°C - (height(thousand ft) * 2°C)`
  - `DA = Pressure Altitude + 120 * (Actual Temperature - ISA Temperature)`
  - **Eg. Cooma Aerodrome**
    - `Elevation: 3106 ft & QNH 1000 hPa & 12°C`
    - `ISA Temperature = 15°C - 3.496 * 2°C = 8°C`
    - `PA = 3496 ft`
    - `DA = 3496 + 120 * (12 - 8) = 3976 ft`
- Takeoff Performance
  - Takeoff distance margin whenever build to "P" chart is normally `1.15`.
  - Takeoff Safety Speed `TOSS`
  - Takeoff Distance Required `TODR`
- Landing Performance
- **Improving** Factors
  - **Decreasing** Landing Distance
    - Dry runway / No water on the runway
    - Upslope
    - Decreasing weight
    - Headwind

  - **Decreasing** Takeoff Distance
    - Dry runway / No water on the runway
    - Downslope

    - Headwind
- V-speed
  - `V_FE` Maximum flap extended speed
  - `V_FO` Maximum flap operating speed
  - `V_NO` Maximum structural cruising speed or maximum speed for normal operations
  - `V_NE` Never exceed speed
  - `V_R` Rotation speed
