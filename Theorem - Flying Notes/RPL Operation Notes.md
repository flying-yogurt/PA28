### 5. Turning

**Effect on Stall Speed:** \[\text{New Stall Speed} = \text{Old Stall Speed} \times \sqrt{G}\]

### 6. Stalling

#### HASELL Checks

- **Height:** Sufficient to recover, by at least **3,000 ft AGL**.
- **Airframe:** Flaps, landing gear, brakes and trim.
- **Security:** Loose items, harnesses.
- **Engine:** Fuel on **FULLEST** tank, fuel pump **ON**, engine instrument in **GREEN**, mixture **RICH** and carby heat **ON**.
- **Location:** Airspace, populated area, landing site.
- **Lookout:** 360Â° turn.

#### Clean Stall Entry

Clean stall are entered from straight and level flight.

* HASELL checks;
* Reference point selected;
* Fuel pump on;
* Carby heat on;
* Close throttle to idle;
* Slowly raise the nose and maintain altitude, allowing the airspeed to decrease;
* Maintain reference point with rudder.

#### Clean Stall Recovery

**Simultaneously:**
* Aileron neutral;
* Relax the back pressure, set attitude for S & L;
* Rudder to prevent further yaw or wing drop;
* Apply full power.

**When the wing are un-stalled:**
* Level the wings with aileron;
* Raise the nose to the climb attitude *(Warning: be cautious of secondary stall)*
* Resume normal climb and complete the After Take Off checks.

#### Approach Stall Entry

This stall simulates the aeroplane coming in to land in the approach configuration.

* HASELL checks;
* Reference point selected;
* Fuel pump on;
* Carby heat on;
* Reduce power to 1,500 RPM;
* Select 2 stage of flap when airspeed in white arc and trim;
* Slowly raise the nose and maintain altitude, allowing the airspeed to decrease;
* Maintain reference point with rudder.

#### Approach Stall Recovery

**Simultaneously:**
* Aileron neutral;
* Relax the back pressure, set attitude for S & L;
Rudder to prevent further yaw or wing drop;
Apply full power.

**When the wing are un-stalled:**
* Level the wings with aileron;
* Raise the nose to the climb attitude *(Warning: be cautious of secondary stall)*
* After achieving at least 60 KIAS and a positive rate of climb, retract flaps and on stage at a time
* Resume normal climb and complete the After Take Off checks.

#### Incipient Spin Recovery

**Simultaneously:**
* Ailerons neutral;
* Reduce power to idle;
* Apply sufficient forward pressure to unstall the wings and apply full and opposite rudder;
* Once rotation stops, release rudder pressure.

**When the wing are un-stalled:**
* Level the wings with aileron;
* Add full power, carby heat off;
* Raise the nose to the climb attitude;
* Resume normal climb and complete the After Take Off checks.
